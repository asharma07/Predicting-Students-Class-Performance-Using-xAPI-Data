# Predicting-Students-Class-Performance-Using-Experience (xAPI)-Data
Online Learning Industry is evolving constantly. There are tons of data available that can be used to find hidden insights by tracking student learning activities using Experience API. In this project, I used a classification algorithm to predict students class performance based on students behavioral attributes data collected using Experience API. I hope you find my code useful. Thank You.
